# GuidedProject2_ElevationAnalysis


## Project Overview
This project provides a Python-based solution for extracting and visualizing water boundary elevation data from a geotiff file using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and ArcGIS Pro. It enables querying elevation values for boundary points and saves them as a GIS-compatible shapefile for further analysis.

## Repository Contents
- **GuidedProject2_Report.pdf**: Detailed report on how the code was developed and how to use it.
- **GuidedProject2_Layout.pdf**: Final layout map showing the visualized elevation data in ArcGIS Pro.
- **project2.py**: The main Python script used for elevation extraction and shapefile generation.
- **project2.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook version of the script for interactive usage.
- **Project2_Script.py**: An additional Python script included in the project.

## How to Use the Code
1. Extract the contents of the project folder.
2. Open `GuidedProject2_Report.pdf` for detailed instructions on:
   - Setting up the Python environment and installing dependencies.
   - Running the Python script (`project2.py` or `project2.ipynb`).
   - Visualizing results using `GuidedProject2_Layout.pdf`.
3. Run the Python scripts to process boundary points and generate the shapefile.

## Output Verification
- The processed shapefile can be visualized in ArcGIS Pro.
- The layout map (`GuidedProject2_Layout.pdf`) demonstrates the final visualization of the extracted elevation data.
